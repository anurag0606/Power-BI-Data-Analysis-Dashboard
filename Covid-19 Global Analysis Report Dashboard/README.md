## 🎯 Business Problem

During the pandemic, tracking the real-time spread of COVID-19 and analyzing its impact was crucial.  
This dashboard helps address key questions such as:

- Which countries have the highest confirmed and death counts?
- What are the global recovery and fatality rates?
- How do trends in confirmed, recovered, and death cases compare over time?
- Which countries achieved the highest recovery rates and lowest fatality rates?

## 📁 Dataset

**Source:** Public COVID-19 data from WHO / Johns Hopkins University (2020–2023)

**Key Columns Used:**

- `Country/Region`
- `Date` (Year, Month, Day)
- `Confirmed Cases`
- `Deaths`
- `Recovered Cases`
- `Active Cases`

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI** – Dashboard design and interactivity
- **Excel / CSV Dataset** – Source data
- **Power Query** – Data transformation and cleaning
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Calculations for KPIs
- **Map Visuals & Line Charts** – For regional and time-series analysis

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation

- Removed duplicate and null entries
- Converted date formats for time-based filtering
- Calculated new metrics:
  - **Case Fatality Rate (CFR%)** = (Deaths / Confirmed) × 100
  - **Recovery Rate (%)** = (Recovered / Confirmed) × 100
  - **Active Cases** = Confirmed − (Recovered + Deaths)
- Merged country-level summaries for mapping visuals
